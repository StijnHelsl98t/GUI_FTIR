# GUI_FTIR
Fully open source Gui made for FTIR simulation/data analysis (using python RADIS)

# Purpose
- Within my own project, we are focussing on the injection of trace methane behind a microwave plasma. The source gas for this microwave plasma will be either hydrogen or oxygen. The objective is to destroy as much of the methane as possible, while using as little energy as necesarry. 
- A colleague of mine is interested in using a mix of nitrogen and oxygen as an source gas for the microwave plasma.

Because of our focus, a GUI has been created that can both simulate FTIR spectra as well as fit calculated spectra to the gained experimental spectra. Within this GUI, in total 24 molecules have been chosen to be listed, which include all of the Hitran molecule-options which contain a combination of H, N, O and C. 

If someone wants to run the GUI as is, all one needs to do is install the python-code and run it as it is. If however, someone is interested in different molecules than us, one can instead change the list which includes all of the chosen molecules.
